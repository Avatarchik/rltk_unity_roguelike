# Introduction
These tutorials utilize [RLTK](https://github.com/sarkahn/rltk_unity), a framework for making Roguelikes in Unity. RLKT should have automatically been included as a package when you downloaded this project - you should see it in your packages folder.

Each chapter of these tutorials is mostly self-contained aside from a couple of common utilities used throughout (found in the Common folder). In the folder for each chapter will find a readme. The readmes will generally *not* be a step-by-step guide, but rather an overview of how the different pieces of the chapter fit together to achieve the result. The goal of these tutorials is not to teach you how to code or how Unity's ECS system actually works - the goal is to create a game.

This tutorial is not intended for someone who is a complete beginner to Unity or someone with little to no programming experience. Before proceeding you should have some familiarity with Unity and be prepared to dig through some source code to figure out how things work.

Unless you have an MD reader I would generally recommend just reading the readmes on [github](https://github.com/sarkahn/rltk_unity_roguelike/blob/master/Assets/Introduction.md), since your browser should display MD files properly.
