# Unity Roguelike Tutorial
A unity port of TheBracket's [Roguelike Tutorial in Rust - using RLTK](https://github.com/thebracket/rustrogueliketutorial).

This project relies on my renderer [RLTK for Unity](https://github.com/sarkahn/rltk_unity), which is itself a port of TheBracket's fantastic ASCII rendering engine for Rust.

RLTK should be automatically included in the project via the package manager when you open the project in Unity. As of right now creating custom user packages is a very arcane process so it's possible I could screw something up along the way. If RLTK isn't downloading properly or is throwing errors you can remove it via the package manager, download/clone it directly from the [github repo](https://github.com/sarkahn/rltk_unity) and install it directly in your assets folder.

All documentation will be hosted in the repo and included in the project when you download it via ".md" files. You can read it locally or on github.
