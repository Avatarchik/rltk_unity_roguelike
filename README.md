# Unity Roguelike Tutorial
A unity port of TheBracket's [Roguelike Tutorial in Rust - using RLTK](https://github.com/thebracket/rustrogueliketutorial).

This project relies on my renderer [RLTK for Unity](https://github.com/sarkahn/rltk_unity), which is itself a port of TheBracket's fantastic ASCII rendering engine for Rust.

In order to run the tutorial inside Unity you'll need to install RLTK alongside this project - preferrably using the Unity Package Manager. You can see the RLTK repository for details on how to do that.
