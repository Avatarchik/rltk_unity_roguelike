# Unity ECS Roguelike Tutorial

This is a set of tutorials for creating a "traditional" ascii based roguelike in Unity. Please read the introduction if this is your first time here.

These tutorials will always be free and the code will always be open source. With that being said I put quite a lot of work into them. If you find them useful, please consider donating. Any amount you can spare would really help me out a great deal - thank you!

These tutorials are based off TheBracket's [Roguelike Tutorial in Rust - using RLTK](https://github.com/thebracket/rustrogueliketutorial).

This project is very much a work in progress. Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/sarkahn/rltk_unity_roguelike/issues)
if you see any obvious mistakes or errors. 

This project was written in Unity 2019.3.06f with the Entities package v 0.5.1.
